Sensor Watch is a board swap for the classic Casio F-91W wristwatch. It brings the power of a Cortex M0+ microcontroller to your wrist, while reusing many elements of the original watch such as its low-power LCD, water-resistant enclosure and beepy piezo buzzer.

Sensor Watch is [available on Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/oddly-specific-objects/sensor-watch), with most backer boards shipping in Q3 2022, and new orders shipping in Q1 2023.
