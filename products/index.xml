Sensor Watch is a board swap for the classic Casio F-91W wristwatch. It brings the power of a Cortex M0+ microcontroller to your wrist, while reusing many elements of the original watch such as its low-power LCD, water-resistant enclosure and beepy piezo buzzer.
Sensor Watch is available on Crowd Supply, with most backer boards shipping in Q3 2022, and new orders shipping in Q1 2023.
